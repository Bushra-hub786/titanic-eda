# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – EDA Project

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `titanic.csv`

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset
- Handle missing data and perform basic data cleaning
- Visualize survival rates based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class (Pclass)
  - Age Distribution

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) were more likely to survive
- Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival
